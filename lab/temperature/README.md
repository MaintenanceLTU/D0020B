## Raspberry pi and cloud services
The objective of the lab is to 
- learn about termperature, heat transfer and therography
- develop skills in IR temperature sensors and thermal camera using Raspberry pi and python 
- develop skills using cloud services by using [Ubidots Education](https://ubidots.com/education/)


The lab consists of two parts
- [Lab - IoT RPi Temperature - Part A.pdf](https://github.com/MaintenanceLTU/D0020B/blob/master/lab_temperature/Lab%20-%20IoT%20RPi%20Temperature%20-%20Part%20A.pdf)
- [Lab - IoT RPi Temperature - Part B.pdf](https://github.com/MaintenanceLTU/D0020B/blob/master/lab_temperature/Lab%20-%20IoT%20RPi%20Temperature%20-%20Part%20B.pdf)
