# ibmvibration
version beta 0.3

This library has basic functionality for reading acceleration
with different types of accelerometers, via I2C, and displaying the 
data in in real-time. 

A device register framwork (registerframework.py) is included to simplify adding other acceleromters
and device specific functionality to these accelerometers.

Currently supported devices:
-STM Electronics LIS331HH

To diplay data in real-time, run "RUN.py".
