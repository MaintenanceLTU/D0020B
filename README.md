### Course aim
The aim of the course is to develop competence and skills for measurement technologies, the Internet of Things and signal analysis in order to perform condition monitoring for maintenance decision support. After the course, the student will 
- have basic knowledge about the Internet of Things and its implementation,
- have basic skills in signal analysis to be able to describe and calculate features in time domain and the frequency content of a signal 
- have the ability to independently and in group undertake tasks for given the settings, as well as demonstrate the ability to identify knowledge gaps     and bridging these gaps by gaining new knowledge.
- understand of how Internet of Things can be used for condition monitoring and maintenance decision support.
